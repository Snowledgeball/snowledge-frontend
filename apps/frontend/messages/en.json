    "item_1_question": "Why does Snowledge focus on community co-creation?",
    "item_1_answer": "Because the best educational content is not created alone. Snowledge allows creators to involve their community from the idea stage, to validate what deserves to be produced, mobilize the right profiles, and share the value created. It's fairer, more efficient, and more sustainable.",
    "item_2_question": "What is the role of artificial intelligence in Snowledge?",
    "item_2_answer": "AI analyzes your community's exchanges to extract clear signals: recurring needs, emerging topics, concrete expectations. It helps you detect what to produce, with whom, and for whom without having to read every message or launch manual surveys.",
    "item_3_question": "Why integrate blockchain into an educational platform?",
    "item_3_answer": "Because recognition, traceability, and fair distribution are essential. Thanks to blockchain, Snowledge automatically records who contributes to what, how, and when, then distributes revenues transparently, without intermediaries.",
    "item_4_question": "What is the deeper purpose behind Snowledge?",
    "item_4_answer": "We want to help change the 'lone creator' dynamic. Too many talents create alone, hope to sell, and burn out. Snowledge is based on a belief: collective intelligence can produce more useful, fairer, and better-paid content. Our mission is to make this model possible—technically, economically, and humanly.",
